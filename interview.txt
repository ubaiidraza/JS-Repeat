1. What is JavaScript?
Answer:
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language used to create interactive effects on web pages. It is primarily used for client-side development but can also be used on the server side with environments like Node.js.
 
2. What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare them?
Answer:
Variables are containers for storing data values.
You can declare variables using:

var (function-scoped, old way)
let (block-scoped, modern)
const (block-scoped, constant)

let x = 10; 
const y = 20; 
var z = 30;
3. What are data types in JavaScript?
Answer:
JavaScript has the following data types:

Primitive: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
Non-Primitive: Object (Arrays, Functions, etc.)
4. What is the difference between == and ===?
Answer:

== compares values only (type coercion occurs).
=== compares both values and types (strict equality).

5 == "5";   // true
5 === "5";  // false
5. What are JavaScript functions? How do you define them?
Answer:
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
You can define functions as:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Function Declaration
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// Function Expression
const greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello!");
};

// Arrow Function
const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
6. What is an array? How do you create one?
Answer:
An array is a collection of elements stored in a single variable.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Accesses "Apple"
7. What is the difference between null and undefined?
Answer:

undefined: A variable is declared but not assigned a value.
null: Intentionally assigned to a variable to represent "no value."
8. What are JavaScript objects?
Answer:
Objects are collections of key-value pairs.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
};
console.log(person.name); // "John"
9. What is the DOM?
Answer:
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document. It allows JavaScript to manipulate elements dynamically.

10. What are events in JavaScript?
Answer:
Events are actions or occurrences (like clicks, hovers) that JavaScript can respond to.

javascript
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
11. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Answer:

var: Function-scoped, hoisted, allows redeclaration.
let: Block-scoped, not hoisted, no redeclaration.
const: Block-scoped, must be initialized, no reassignment.
12. What is hoisting in JavaScript?
Answer:
Hoisting is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution.

javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
13. Explain closures in JavaScript.
Answer:
A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope even after the outer function has executed.

javascript
Copy
Edit
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
14. What is the this keyword in JavaScript?
Answer:
this refers to the object that is currently executing the code. Its value depends on how the function is called.

15. What is the difference between map() and forEach()?
Answer:

map(): Creates a new array by applying a function to each element.
forEach(): Iterates over an array but doesnâ€™t return a new array.
javascript
Copy
Edit
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = nums.map(num => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
nums.forEach(num => console.log(num)); // Logs: 1, 2, 3
